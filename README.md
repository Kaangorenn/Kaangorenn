👋 Hi, I’m @Kaangorenn.

🎓 I'm 21 years old and recently graduated from ROC Amsterdam Zuidoost with a degree in Software Development.

👀 I’m interested in airsoft, riding my motorcycle, gaming, making music, and of course coding.

🌱 I work with Nuxt.js, Tailwind CSS, Laravel, MySQL, and SQLite. I enjoy exploring new technologies and frameworks to expand my skill set and keep up with the latest trends in the software development industry. My current projects involve building web applications that are both efficient and visually appealing, leveraging the power of these tools to create seamless user experiences.
